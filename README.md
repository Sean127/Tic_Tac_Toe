# Tic Tac Toe 

For this project i decided toc create a simple Tic Tac Toe game. I have designed a simple two-player game that is simply operated by clicking on your desired box. I hope this site can show how Javascript along with relatively simple HTML and CSS can be used to create fun to play games that everyone can enjoy.

### Game Area

The game area is a simple 3x3 box area that the user clickes on when it is their go. Above they will find info about which player is which and how to start the game. They will also find a reset button at the bottom that can be used to reset the game at any point.
